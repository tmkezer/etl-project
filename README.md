# etl-project

For my ETL project, I decided to work with something I'm passionate about... Video Games! 

I recently relapsed and have been playing a fair amount of World of Warcraft (BfA).

I was able to identify a few data sets from kaggle.com that sparked my interest. Unfortunately, these data sets are all from past expansion but stil quite exhaustive.
